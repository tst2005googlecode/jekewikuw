## Download Code ##
Create a new file on your computer and within this file right-click and under TortoiseHG select "clone". A new dialogue will open that lets you set the source and destination. In the Source line enter this projects url (https://critter2555@code.google.com/p/jekewikuw/) and verify that Destination is the location of the new folder that you made. Then hit Clone to download the files.

## Building the Game ##
To build the game double click the build.batch file in the main folder. If successful a new game.love file will be created that you can run. If the build failed you may have to change the build.batch file with the correct location of the 7zip.

The code to the program is all found in the source folder. Visit love2d.org to learn more.
